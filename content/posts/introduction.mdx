Welcome to my page! My name is Philip, and I'm thrilled to share my journey,
projects, and thoughts here. This portfolio is a collection of my work, where I
showcase my passion & dedication for software engineering and continuous
learning.

## A Bit About Me

I graduated [University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/) with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science in December of 2023.
Throughout my studies, I've worked on exciting projects like _**Forest Wildfire Detection**_ using Computer Vision, _**MP4 File Recovery**_, and _**Employee Rewards System**_ using cryptocurrency for my senior design project.

\
My recent interests after graduation has been in Generative AI, Data Visualization, and Full-stack Web Development.
