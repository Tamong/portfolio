Anthropic released the Claude 3.7 Sonnet model yesterday and I was curious to test its coding capabilities on something fun and interactive. Having been impressed by early reviews, I decided to challenge Claude to create a complete Tetris game using React and TypeScript for my portfolio website.

\
The results were remarkable. In a single prompt, I asked Claude to create a fully functional Tetris game with standard gameplay features (rotation, line clearing, scoring, levels) and responsive design. To my surprise, it generated the entire codebase in one go - including game logic hooks, board rendering, piece rotation algorithms, collision detection, and scoring mechanics.

The most impressive part was the quality of the code. Claude organized the game
with clean component architecture and proper TypeScript typing. What's more, it seamlessly followed the same format and structure as my previous
[Fruit Box game](/posts/making-the-fruit-box-game), making it integrate perfectly into my
existing game collection. The only post-generation work required was fixing a
few linting warnings to satisfy my project's ESLint configuration, mostly
related to optional chaining syntax and possible object undefined warnings.

\
What would have taken me days to code manually was accomplished in minutes with Claude 3.7. The model demonstrated a deep understanding of React patterns, game development concepts, and the ability to generate a cohesive, bug-free application with minimal guidance. For developers looking to prototype quickly or learn how to implement complex game mechanics, modern AI assistants like Claude 3.7 are transformative tools worth exploring.
